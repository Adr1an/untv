# Node Webkit 0.8.4-custom

In order to support as many video/audio formats as possible, UNTV depends on a 
custom patched build of node-webkit.

Since the binary is too large for us to commit, you will need to download it 
from: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3ne1qsdxtc848z6/Rx4dnzgu5S

Select the directory for your target platform and copy that directory into here.

So if you are working on 64 bit GNU/Linux, you would have: 
`bin/nw-0.8.4-custom/linux64` containing the proper node-webkit files.

Unzip and place the contents in this directory.
